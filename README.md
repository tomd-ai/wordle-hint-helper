# Streamlit Wordle Solver
A demo project to show off control flow features in streamlit and pay tribute to one of my favourite word games.

(PS. I used an old dictionary file I had on my hard drive, apologies in advance if some of the words are a little archaic - there's quite a few...)

## A fun version of the game, developed in streamlit

Fancy a game?

In the play tab, enter a word in the box to see how many times you have to guess before you find the word!

## A hint algorithm

Need a little help with today's wordle?

Enter the letters you have found, the letters that are in the word, and those that aren't, and it returns letters/words that are the best to choose next!

## A wordle solver demonstration

Just want to see the solving algorithm in action?

Either enter a 5 letter word or choose one from the dictionary, and the algorithm will try to get it in in 6 guesses!

It shows you the best letters to choose for each position, and works out the word that has the most of those letters to choose next.
